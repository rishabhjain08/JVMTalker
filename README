What the library does ?
You can connect to a remote JVM and debug it programatically. The library
exposes methods like addBreakpoint and removeBreakpoint which take a callback
method as input which is invoked when the JVM executes the breakpoint.
How to use the library ?
Take a look at src/wrapper/src/test package to see how to use the library.
How to get started ?
Just add JVMTalker.jar from out/artifacts/JVMTalker_jar/JVMTalker.jar to your
project and use the library as demonstrated in the test package.

Note: Depends on Intellij SDK v162.2032.8
